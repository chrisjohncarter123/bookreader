# Book Reader

It is a super simple application for managing a database from the front end. 
Uses Rails for back-end and JavaScript for the front end.

## Getting Started

Download and run on a server. I used port 3002 on local host for the fetch requests.

### Prerequisites

Rails

### Installing

Install and update gems with this command:

```
bundle install
```

## Usage

Run the server with rails s

```
rails s
```

Or, to run on a specific port:

```
rails s -p 3001
```
